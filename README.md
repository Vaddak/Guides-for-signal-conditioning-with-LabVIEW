Development of Conditioning System for Sensor Technology and Data Acquisition Using LabVIEW

------------------ REPORT 1 ------------------ 
In this practice, three temperature sensors (LM25, MCP9701, type K thermocouple) were connected to a 
National Instruments USB-6008 module, using LabVIEW software to measure temperature in different 
environments such as parts of the human body, the ambient environment, and a heat gun. The sensors were 
characterized and their signals conditioned with subtractors and dividers to correct unwanted offsets. 
The obtained results were analyzed through tables and graphs to ensure their consistency and accuracy 
by comparing the measurements from the three sensors. The main objectives were to obtain consistent 
temperature values, make a proper connection of the sensors to the acquisition system, and condition 
the signals from the software to achieve reliable results.

This laboratory report analyzes the behavior of electrical current in direct current (DC) and alternating 
current (AC) circuits as resistance varies, using devices such as the Variac, USB NI 6008 module, ACS712, 
rheostat, and power supply, controlled through LabVIEW. 
The study focuses on how changes in resistance affect current in both configurations, contributing to a
deeper understanding of the principles of electronics and electrical engineering. The objectives include 
visualizing, through experimental data, how current varies when modifying resistance in AC and DC, and 
correctly setting up the instrumentation for each system, managed from LabVIEW.

This report focuses on the analysis of the FC2231-25 load cell, a high-performance sensor used to 
precisely measure mechanical forces and stresses, essential in various industrial and scientific applications. 
The load cell converts mechanical deformations into proportional electrical signals, based on the variation 
in electrical resistance caused by mechanical stress on sensitive conductive materials. The study aims 
to implement precise calibration to eliminate voltage offsets, evaluate the linearity and sensitivity of 
the load cell by applying known loads, and analyze the results to identify factors affecting its performance 
in force and load measurement.

In this laboratory practice, the goal is to develop a distance measurement system based on ultrasonic technology, 
using the SRF04 sensor to emit and receive ultrasonic waves, allowing the determination of the distance between 
the sensor and an object. This system is crucial for applications in robotics and industrial monitoring. To 
process the data, the NI 6008 module from National Instruments will be used along with LabVIEW software, providing 
a precise and efficient solution. The objectives include developing the measurement system, characterizing the 
SRF04 sensor to ensure proper emission and reception of ultrasonic waves, and programming a process in LabVIEW 
for real-time data acquisition and processing, ensuring accurate visualization of the results.


------------------ REPORT 5 ------------------ 
This practice aims to implement a data acquisition system to capture and record in real-time the pressure 
changes induced by a compressor. The MPX5100 pressure sensor is used, connected to an analog port of the 
USB NI 6008 module, which serves as the interface between the sensor and LabVIEW software. LabVIEW is 
responsible for system programming and data visualization in graphs, facilitating analysis and interpretation. 
The objectives include developing the acquisition system with LabVIEW and the NI 6008 module, configuring 
accurate communication between them to measure pressure changes, and conducting experimental measurements 
with different compression levels, ensuring accuracy and repeatability of real-time measurements.


------------------ REPORT 6 ------------------ 
In this experiment, the voltage response of the FS1012-1100-NG sensor was measured and analyzed when 
connected to an air compressor. This sensor is capable of measuring pressure in an environment and 
generating a voltage output proportional to the applied pressure. The sensor was powered with a 5V 
source via a USB charger, and voltage variations were captured using a data acquisition module connected 
to an analog port of the USB NI 6008. This system allowed the recording of pressure variations generated 
by the compressor. The objectives included correctly assembling the system both in hardware and software 
in LabVIEW, analyzing the quasi-linear relationship between voltage and applied pressure, and obtaining 
an appropriate calibration equation for the sensor, considering its non-linear nature.

This report presents an experimental study on the characterization and control of a direct current (DC) 
motor using the National Instruments USB-6008 Data Acquisition Module and the LabVIEW platform. In 
the first part of the experiment, the DC motor was characterized using an H-bridge and a potentiometer 
to vary its speed, recording input and output signals to analyze its response to different control 
signals. In the second part, the motor’s rotational speed and direction were measured using an encoder 
and a D-type flip-flop (74LS74). The objectives include applying motor control and characterization 
techniques, analyzing its response to control signals, and measuring its speed and direction of rotation 
to improve future control strategies.


------------------ REPORT 8 ------------------ 
Measuring and analyzing acceleration is crucial for understanding and characterizing the movements of 
objects in various fields, such as physics, engineering, navigation, and robotics. In this laboratory 
practice, acceleration was studied using the MMA7260 sensor, a three-axis accelerometer, along with the 
NI USB-6008 Data Acquisition Module. The goal was to explore how objects respond to applied forces, 
translating these forces into accelerations in different directions. Through precise measurements, 
changes in the sensor’s velocity and orientation during specific movements and accelerations were 
analyzed, allowing for an evaluation of the relationship between acceleration and spatial orientation, 
and identifying factors that affect the measurements.

This project focused on developing a comprehensive system for wireless temperature measurement using 
the LM35 sensor and XBee modules. The XBee module parameters were configured using XCTU, and the program
